# Missing/Unimplemented Endpoints

This tracker lists every endpoint promised in `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` that is **not** backed by an Express route under `src/routes/v1`. Use it to prioritize the remaining gap between the published contract and the live backend.

---

## Summary Statistics

- ✅ **Implemented**: ~194 endpoints (~100%)
- ❌ **Missing**: 0 endpoints (0%)

---

All endpoints described in `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` now have matching Express route handlers (including the self-service user profile APIs, full `/students/...` alias set, lecturer/admin role-specific namespaces, bursary payment tools, and the webhook stubs). This document will be updated again if future gaps are identified.
